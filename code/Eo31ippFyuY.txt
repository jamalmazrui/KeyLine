hello and welcome to inclusive design 24

for 2018 this is our pre-conference

countdown because kickoff for our first

talk is just mere minutes away but

before we do that I'm delighted to be

joined by several of the id24 organizing

team say hello everyone and also by the

lovely people we are very proud and

happy to count as our partners for

inclusive design 24 micro CLO Melanie

Richards David Caldwell

Sarah Poulos and Andrew arch and it

would be great just to talk to all of

you about your reasons for being part of

this interesting and exciting 24 hour

event so Sarah and Andrew from intopia

can I perhaps ask you what prompted you

to get involved and become partners for

id24 for us we just love the concept of

being able to share so much expertise

from around the world with so many

people I guess being in Australia but

are always a little bit out of sync with

everyone else particularly and it's also

a little bit harder for us to connect

with a lot of our international partners

for us geographically in particular it's

this awesome experience that people

commune in interactively presenters

during presentation after the

presentation and just learn more and

share the passion around what you need

and then follow up with the ones that

particular interest to them following

because it's great that you always put

them online and make them available

afterwards yeah that was always a big

part of our mission with this was to

create something that not only existed

for the 24 hours itself but was around

for long after so that anyone who wasn't

around to engage during the 24 hours kid

could take time to

listen to the talks afterwards Melanie

you join us from the Microsoft edge team

what brought you to the inclusive design

24 table yes so you know Microsoft's

mission is all about empowering everyone

to achieve more and locally on the

Microsoft edge team and that means the

web just works for everyone so no matter

you know someone this ability or context

or environment you know they can

participate in the web and so we're

super thrilled to be able to support the

community and really sharing that

knowledge and building up everybody

skills and creating an inclusive web and

it's super lovely that you know this is

free and online and people can join from

wherever they already are so I thought

that was really cool so thank you for

putting this on I know totally this it's

terrific to have Microsoft and the edge

team supporting us on this one

I should tend to David Coldwell now from

Barclays the Barclays Bank accessibility

team David you and Barclays accessive

have been one of our greatest champions

for id24 what's your perception of the

event this year look we love being part

of a only 24 and we've got this big this

undercurrent of wanting to help and

build and grow a community of

professionals across the world around

inclusive design around accessibility

cuz like all the people in here we know

that this can't just be a bunch of

accessibility professionals it's got to

be everybody and sort of part of our

ambition to become the most accessible

inclusive but to come me there's a

recognition in there that we can't do

that alone

so only 24 gives us a great opportunity

to obscure our people because you know

thousands of Barclays colleagues across

the world are gonna be watching us

because we've got people across the

world and but also it will help upskill

a lot of people from other companies

great and we really hope they will be

tuning in wherever they are and I think

you've touched on something that's

really important to the spirit of id24

and that's that idea

we can't do this on our own none of us

can we need more people more creative

ideas more inputs and if this is a way

to help that happen then that's really

wonderful to hear thank you David for

helping us make it happen last but by

absolutely no means least we need to

turn to Mike passio who is without

question our original ID 24 champion

he's the one who when he heard about the

idea that we had many many years ago was

the first one to actually put in place

the support mechanisms to make it happen

so Mike is great to have you here for

the fifth id24 what interests you about

this idea what makes it worthwhile to be

part of things

thanks very much Leonie and of course

it's great to be here to square me to be

here with a lot of friends and

colleagues in the field good to see some

new sponsors this year for ID 20 for us

as Leonie said this was an idea that we

had several years ago and it really was

a matter of me and a couple of our folks

and in TPG giving it a little boost and

a little pinch so to speak and get it up

and get it running and and we did and so

to be here for five years later with the

underlying theme still being saying that

is that we feel that so much of our time

as technologists in the field of

inclusion and disability and

accessibility is something that we spend

for companies and corporate environments

maybe even nonprofits but it's time for

us this is our 24 hours in our friends

and our colleagues to give back to to

our friends and to our friends with

disabilities certainly to those who are

actually thinking about a design

development UX and another a number of

different technologies where

accessibility needs to you know to live

and breathe and be like air it should be

free it should be a part of a whole and

it should be a part of what you all of

you folks have been doing for for these

many years

building into your systems and your

platforms and that's really what this

session is other than that I just want

the order to know that I'm dressed in my

suit

Mike I can't imagine you dressed in

anything else so it's good to know thank

you and and I might you made it a great

point there about you know keeping id24

free open for everybody caption so it's

as inclusive as we can make it and

really to all of you thank you so much

for for partnering with us to do this

because it's it's your help

truly that makes that that a possible

thing so thank you I'm gonna keep this

over now to the rest of the id24 team

who are here with me just to find out

what everybody's really looking forward

to over the next 24 hours and I'm just

going to leave you with a parting shot

that the one talk I'm really looking

forward to is the one on web payments TP

g's activities at w3c are very important

to many of us and that's a w3c standard

so Marcus's talk on that is the one I'm

really looking forward to but Ian what's

what's on your top score card for the 24

hours they see you so much I think we've

got a great opening talk with Bruce

since Aaron who are going to really set

the tone for id24 I think this year

talking about how the web is supposed to

be for it for everyone and then we close

out with with Aaron talking about

performance and how it

cuase to accessibility and I think

that's that's a connection that is often

missed is not considered and if I can

pick one more I'm going to pick Andy

Bell power of progressive enhancement

it's nice as a as a developer to know

that it's not just you know my old

grumpy Developer Forum attitude what's

do web development pass on to lady

Leland well there are a ton of good ones

here but I happen to be starting at noon

the eastern time which syncs up with the

co.design approach to automated cooking

appliances this one is fascinating to me

because it's outside of the standard web

stuff that that we do every day and it

also might fit very well with a story

I'm writing about armor

skillet so this disconnection hey and

there's a Scott is that Scott I see

Scott what are you looking for a there

yeah I don't know there's a lot of

really great talks this this year I'm

particularly looking forward to Glendon

wilcos uh accessibility Wars because

that sounds quite interesting to me as

well as Kathleen her excessively

accessibility flavored react components

just been seen a lot of chatter about

react and accessibility lately so I'd

love to see a talk about that and be

able to then show it to a bunch of

people yeah I was talking to Kathleen

just before the conference and and she's

really just bubbling with ideas around

that so I think no one's gonna be a

great talk you're right Scott okay - we

need to wrap up we just ah that's so

that's all of us for now we are going to

jump off this we will be setting up the

first official id24 2018 at the top of

the hour so please join us then

okay
