ftfy (fixes text for you), version 5.8

positional arguments:
  filename              The file whose Unicode is to be fixed. Defaults to -,

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        The file to output to. Defaults to -, meaning standard
                        output.
  -g, --guess           Ask ftfy to guess the encoding of your input. This is
                        risky. Overrides -e.

  --preserve-entities   Leave HTML entities as they are. The default is to
                        decode them, as long as no HTML tags have appeared in
                        the file.
