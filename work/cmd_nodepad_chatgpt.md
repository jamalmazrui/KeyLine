Here’s how to restore the traditional cmd.exe command-line and replace the new notepad.exe with the traditional version on Windows 11:

Restoring the Traditional cmd.exe Command-Line
Access Default App Settings for Command-Line:

Open the Start menu and search for "Settings."
Navigate to Privacy & security > For developers or search for "Developer Settings."
Under the "Terminal" section, look for "Default terminal application."
Change the Default Terminal:

Set the default terminal application to Windows Console Host (which runs the traditional cmd.exe).
Confirm the Change:

Open a new Command Prompt session (Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter) to verify that the traditional console environment appears.
Replacing the New Notepad with the Traditional Version
Locate a Copy of the Traditional Notepad:

Check if your previous computer or an older Windows 10 installation has the traditional notepad.exe.
Alternatively, download the Windows 10 version of notepad.exe from a trusted source.
Back Up the Existing Notepad:

Navigate to C:\Windows\System32 and locate the current notepad.exe.
Rename it to notepad_new.exe as a backup.
Replace the Executable:

Copy the traditional notepad.exe file into the C:\Windows\System32 directory.
Disable Automatic Updates for Notepad:

Open the Microsoft Store app.
Go to Library > Apps installed.
Locate Notepad in the list, right-click it, and select "Turn off automatic updates" or similar.
Verify Functionality:

Open Notepad from the Start menu or by typing notepad in the Run dialog (Win + R) and confirm the older version is active.
Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further assistance!


You said:
Can you tell me a trusted source for the older notepad.exe? Is there no copy of this somewhere on the Windows 11 installation? Can the older cmd.exe be made the default through programmatic means, or is it necessary to manual adjust settings?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s how to address your concerns about trusted sources, existing copies of older software, and making the older cmd.exe the default programmatically:

1. Trusted Sources for Traditional Notepad
Unfortunately, Microsoft does not provide an official download for older versions of notepad.exe. However, there are potential solutions:

From Older Windows Installations: If you have access to a computer running Windows 10 or an earlier version, you can copy the notepad.exe from:

C:\Windows\System32
Make sure to copy both notepad.exe and notepad.exe.mui (located in C:\Windows\System32\en-US or the relevant language folder).

Third-Party Tools: Websites like Archive.org or community forums like TenForums may have users sharing original Windows files. Ensure you scan any downloaded files with antivirus software.

2. Is the Older Notepad Already on Windows 11?
Yes, it’s possible the older Notepad is present but hidden:

Try launching the old Notepad directly:
Press Win + R, type:
notepad.exe
If this launches the older version, you don’t need further adjustments.
Search in the Windows Backup:
Look under C:\Windows.old\Windows\System32 if your system was upgraded from Windows 10.
If found, copy it to C:\Windows\System32 after backing up the current version.
3. Programmatic Adjustments for cmd.exe
While you can change the default terminal manually, it’s also possible to do this programmatically. Here’s how:

Using the Registry Editor:
Open the Registry Editor (Win + R, type regedit, and press Enter).
Navigate to the following key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Terminal\Settings
Look for a key like DefaultTerminalApplication.
Set its value to:
{0caa0dad-35be-5f56-a8ff-afceeeaa6101}
This GUID corresponds to the Windows Console Host.
Using a Script (PowerShell):
To automate the change, create a .ps1 script:

Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Terminal\Settings" -Name "DefaultTerminalApplication" -Value "{0caa0dad-35be-5f56-a8ff-afceeeaa6101}"
Run it with elevated permissions.

Final Recommendations
Always back up your files before making changes to system directories or the registry.
For replacing or reverting Notepad, copying from a trusted Windows 10 installation is the safest method.
Programmatic changes for cmd.exe are straightforward, but manual verification afterward ensures it works as expected.

How to Use the Script
Copy the code into a file and save it with a .vbs extension, for example, ChangeToCmd.vbs.
Run the script with administrative privileges:
Right-click the .vbs file and select Run as Administrator.
Easy Way to Verify the Change
Open the Registry Editor (Win + R, type regedit, and press Enter).
Navigate to:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Terminal\Settings
Check if the value DefaultTerminalApplication exists and is set to:
{0caa0dad-35be-5f56-a8ff-afceeeaa6101}
Alternative (Programmatic Verification): You can use this VBScript to read and verify the value:

Option Explicit

Dim sRegPath, sValueName, sExpectedValue, oShell, sCommand, sOutput
sRegPath = "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Terminal\Settings"
sValueName = "DefaultTerminalApplication"
sExpectedValue = "{0caa0dad-35be-5f56-a8ff-afceeeaa6101}"

Set oShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")

On Error Resume Next
sOutput = oShell.RegRead(sRegPath & "\" & sValueName)
On Error GoTo 0

If sOutput = sExpectedValue Then
WScript.Echo "The default terminal application is correctly set to Windows Console Host."
Else
WScript.Echo "The default terminal application is NOT correctly set."
End If
Save this as VerifyCmdSetting.vbs and run it to confirm the change.

How can I manuall tell if I have opened the old console environment instead of the new one? What is some property I can check that distinguishes the UI?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To manually distinguish between the old console environment (Windows Console Host) and the new Terminal environment in Windows 11, you can check several properties of the UI:

Key Differences Between Old Console and New Terminal
Title Bar Appearance:

Old Console (cmd.exe in Windows Console Host):
Has a simple title bar.
The title typically shows "Command Prompt" or the current path.
No tabs are present.
New Terminal:
Features a more modern, sleek title bar.
Includes tabs for opening multiple sessions within the same window.
Right-Click Menu:

Old Console:
The right-click menu is simpler and offers basic options like "Mark" and "Paste."
New Terminal:
Includes more advanced options, such as "Open Tab," "Settings," and additional commands for managing tabs.
Settings Access:

Old Console:
Access settings via the title bar menu (right-click the title bar, then choose "Properties").
New Terminal:
Settings are accessed through a gear icon in the title bar or a shortcut (Ctrl + ,).
Transparency Effect:

Old Console:
No transparency effects.
New Terminal:
Supports transparency and blur effects in the background (if enabled).
Font Options:

Old Console:
Basic font options, no support for Cascadia Code or other modern fonts.
New Terminal:
Supports modern fonts like Cascadia Code and richer customization.
Keyboard Shortcuts:

Old Console:
Traditional shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl + C for copy, Alt + Enter for full screen).
New Terminal:
Includes additional shortcuts for managing tabs, panes, and profiles.
Verification Steps
Run a Command Prompt:

Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
Observe the Title Bar:

If you see tabs or a gear icon, you're in the new Terminal.
If not, you're in the old console.
Check the Right-Click Menu:

Right-click anywhere in the window or title bar.
Look for advanced options like "Settings" or tab management.
Command-Line Command:

Run this command:
echo %ComSpec%
Output:
If it shows C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe, you're in the old console.
The new Terminal can still run cmd.exe, but the UI properties above will distinguish them.
These checks will help you reliably determine whether you're using the old or new console environment. Let me know if you'd like further clarification!

Here's a VBScript program to replace the new version of notepad.exe with the old version and attempt to disable automatic updates for Notepad through the Microsoft Store. Note that disabling updates programmatically can be tricky, and this script offers a best-effort approach.

VBScript Program
Option Explicit

' Variables
Dim sSourcePath, sTargetPath, sBackupPath
Dim oFSO, oShell, iResult

' Paths
sSourcePath = ".\notepad.exe" ' Old Notepad in the current directory
sTargetPath = "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe" ' New Notepad location
sBackupPath = "C:\Windows\System32\notepad_new.exe" ' Backup for the new version

' Create FileSystemObject and Shell objects
Set oFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set oShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")

On Error Resume Next

' Step 1: Backup the existing Notepad
If oFSO.FileExists(sTargetPath) Then
oFSO.CopyFile sTargetPath, sBackupPath, True
If Err.Number = 0 Then
WScript.Echo "Backup of the new Notepad created successfully."
Else
WScript.Echo "Failed to create a backup of the new Notepad. Error: " & Err.Description
WScript.Quit 1
End If
End If

' Step 2: Replace the new Notepad with the old one
oFSO.CopyFile sSourcePath, sTargetPath, True
If Err.Number = 0 Then
WScript.Echo "Old Notepad successfully replaced the new Notepad."

WScript.Echo "Failed to replace Notepad. Error: " & Err.Description
WScript.Quit 1
End If

' Step 3: Disable automatic updates for Notepad via the Microsoft Store
Dim sCommand
sCommand = "powershell -Command ""Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe'"""
iResult = oShell.Run(sCommand, 0, True)

If iResult = 0 Then
WScript.Echo "Attempted to exclude Notepad from updates in Microsoft Store."

WScript.Echo "Failed to exclude Notepad from updates."
End If

' Step 4: (Optional) Disable Microsoft Store updates entirely
Dim sDisableUpdatesKey, sValueName
sDisableUpdatesKey = "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsStore"
sValueName = "AutoDownload"
oShell.RegWrite sDisableUpdatesKey & "\" & sValueName, 2, "REG_DWORD"

If Err.Number = 0 Then
WScript.Echo "Microsoft Store updates disabled successfully."
Else
WScript.Echo "Failed to disable Microsoft Store updates. Error: " & Err.Description
End If

WScript.Echo "Script completed."

Backup Current Notepad:

Copies the existing notepad.exe in C:\Windows\System32 to notepad_new.exe.
Replace with Old Notepad:

Replaces the current notepad.exe with the older version from the current directory.
Disable Microsoft Store Updates:

Uses oShell.RegWrite to create a registry key:
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsStore
Value: AutoDownload (set to 2, which disables automatic updates).
Requirements
Run as Administrator:
Elevated privileges are necessary to modify System32 and registry settings.
Manual Verification:
Verify the changes by:
Checking if C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe is replaced.
Confirming the registry key exists:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsStore\AutoDownload
(Set to 2).

You said:
I do not want to disable Microsoft updates generally, only for notepad.exe. Please revise accordingly.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To specifically disable updates for notepad.exe without affecting other Microsoft Store updates, the approach is more nuanced because the Microsoft Store does not have a built-in mechanism to exclude individual apps from updates. However, we can take the following steps with VBScript to minimize the risk of notepad.exe being overwritten:

Mark notepad.exe as "read-only" to prevent modification.
Set file permissions to restrict overwriting.
Rename notepad.exe to a less conventional name if necessary to avoid detection.
Here's the revised VBScript:

VBScript Code
Option Explicit

' Variables
Dim sSourcePath, sTargetPath, sBackupPath, oFSO, oShell

' Paths
sSourcePath = ".\notepad.exe" ' Old Notepad in the current directory
sTargetPath = "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe" ' New Notepad location
sBackupPath = "C:\Windows\System32\notepad_new.exe" ' Backup for the new version

' Create FileSystemObject and Shell objects
Set oFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set oShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")

On Error Resume Next

' Step 1: Backup the existing Notepad
If oFSO.FileExists(sTargetPath) Then
oFSO.CopyFile sTargetPath, sBackupPath, True
If Err.Number = 0 Then
WScript.Echo "Backup of the new Notepad created successfully."
Else
WScript.Echo "Failed to create a backup of the new Notepad. Error: " & Err.Description
WScript.Quit 1
End If
End If

' Step 2: Replace the new Notepad with the old one
oFSO.CopyFile sSourcePath, sTargetPath, True
If Err.Number = 0 Then
WScript.Echo "Old Notepad successfully replaced the new Notepad."
Else
WScript.Echo "Failed to replace Notepad. Error: " & Err.Description
WScript.Quit 1
End If

' Step 3: Set Notepad to Read-Only
Dim oFile
Set oFile = oFSO.GetFile(sTargetPath)
oFile.Attributes = oFile.Attributes Or 1 ' Add read-only attribute

If Err.Number = 0 Then
WScript.Echo "Set Notepad as read-only to prevent updates."
Else
WScript.Echo "Failed to set Notepad as read-only. Error: " & Err.Description
End If

' Step 4: Restrict Permissions (Optional)
Dim sCommand
sCommand = "icacls """ & sTargetPath & """ /deny SYSTEM:(W)"
oShell.Run sCommand, 0, True

If Err.Number = 0 Then
WScript.Echo "Restricted permissions for Notepad to prevent overwriting."
Else
WScript.Echo "Failed to restrict permissions for Notepad. Error: " & Err.Description
End If

WScript.Echo "Script completed."
How This Script Works
Backup Existing Notepad:

Saves the current notepad.exe as notepad_new.exe for safety.
Replace with Old Notepad:

Replaces the new notepad.exe with the old version.
Set Read-Only Attribute:

Marks notepad.exe as read-only, preventing overwriting by Microsoft Store updates.
Restrict File Permissions (Optional):

Uses icacls to deny the SYSTEM account write permissions for notepad.exe, further protecting it from being overwritten.
Verification
Read-Only Attribute:
Check the file properties of C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe and confirm "Read-only" is selected.
Permissions:
Open a Command Prompt and run:
icacls "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"
Ensure the SYSTEM account has DENY WRITE permissions.
Caveats
The Microsoft Store may still try to update notepad.exe. This script reduces the likelihood of overwriting but does not guarantee complete prevention.
Future Windows updates could potentially restore the new notepad.exe.

I want to set the "dircmd" environment variable to the "/b" value so that the "dir" command does not produce noisy output. Please give me a .bat or .cmd file with code to do this. It is OK if the change does not take effect until Windows is rebooted, but after that, the "dir" command should work in the steamlined manner.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here's a .bat or .cmd file to set the DIRCMD environment variable to /b so that the dir command produces streamlined output by default. This change will persist across reboots.

Batch File Code
Save this as SetDirCmd.bat or SetDirCmd.cmd:

@echo off
REM Set the DIRCMD environment variable to use the /b option by default
echo Setting the DIRCMD environment variable...

REM Update the registry to persist the change across reboots
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v DIRCMD /t REG_SZ /d /b /f

REM Notify the user of the change
if %errorlevel% equ 0 (
echo DIRCMD environment variable set to "/b" successfully.
echo The change will take effect after a reboot.
) else (
echo Failed to set the DIRCMD environment variable. Please ensure you have administrative privileges.
)
How It Works
Set the Environment Variable Persistently:

The reg add command modifies the Windows Registry to set the DIRCMD variable in the system-wide environment variables.
Registry Path:

The path modified is:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment
Variable Value:

The /d /b sets the value of DIRCMD to the /b option.
Reboot Required:

The change will take effect only after Windows is restarted.
Steps to Use
Save the code above to a .bat or .cmd file.
Right-click the file and select Run as Administrator to apply the changes.
Reboot your computer to activate the changes.
After rebooting, the dir command will use the /b option by default, providing streamlined output.

Is it possible to set the older cmd.exe for the command-line by only using commands within a batch file? In other words, can this be done in the batch language without requiring PowerShell or VBScript code? It is OK if the batch file calls built-in Windows utilities.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, it is possible to set the older cmd.exe as the default command-line environment using only commands within a batch file by leveraging built-in Windows utilities like reg.exe for registry modifications. Below is a batch file that achieves this by modifying the registry to set the default terminal application to the older Windows Console Host.

Batch File Code
Save this as SetOldCmd.bat:

@echo off
REM Ensure the script is run with administrative privileges
whoami /groups | find "S-1-16-12288" >nul
if errorlevel 1 (
echo This script requires administrative privileges.
echo Please right-click the batch file and select "Run as Administrator."
pause
exit /b
)

REM Set the default terminal application to the old cmd.exe environment
echo Setting the default terminal application to the old cmd.exe...

reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Terminal\Settings" /v DefaultTerminalApplication /t REG_SZ /d "{0caa0dad-35be-5f56-a8ff-afceeeaa6101}" /f

REM Check if the operation was successful
if %errorlevel% equ 0 (
echo Successfully set the old cmd.exe as the default terminal application.
echo The change will take effect the next time you open a Command Prompt.
) else (
echo Failed to set the old cmd.exe as the default terminal application.
echo Please ensure you have administrative privileges and try again.
)

pause
How It Works
Administrative Privileges Check:

The script checks if it is running with administrative privileges using the whoami /groups command. If not, it prompts the user to restart the script with elevated privileges.
Registry Modification:

The reg add command modifies the registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Terminal\Settings
It sets the DefaultTerminalApplication value to:
{0caa0dad-35be-5f56-a8ff-afceeeaa6101}
This GUID corresponds to the Windows Console Host (the old cmd.exe environment).
Error Handling:

The script checks the %errorlevel% after the reg add command to confirm if the registry modification was successful.
Effectiveness:

The change will take effect the next time you open a Command Prompt.
Steps to Use
Save the code to a file named SetOldCmd.bat.
Right-click the file and select Run as Administrator.
Follow the on-screen instructions.
After running the script, open a new Command Prompt window to confirm the change.

Backup Existing Notepad:

Copies the current notepad.exe from C:\Windows\System32 to C:\Windows\System32\notepad_new.exe.
Replace Notepad:

Copies the old notepad.exe from the current directory to C:\Windows\System32.
Protect the File:

Sets the file attributes to Read-Only (+r) and System (+s) to discourage modifications.
Uses icacls to deny the SYSTEM account write permissions to notepad.exe, preventing updates or replacements.
Error Handling:

Checks for errors at each step and provides clear messages for troubleshooting.
Steps to Use
Save the code to a file named RestoreOldNotepad.bat.
Place the old notepad.exe file in the same directory as the batch file.
Right-click the batch file and select Run as Administrator.
Follow the on-screen instructions to ensure the process completes successfully.
Verification
Open C:\Windows\System32 and check the properties of notepad.exe:
It should have the "Read-only" and "System" attributes enabled.
